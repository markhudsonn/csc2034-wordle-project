    "The following notebook was created by Ken Pierce. The intention here give some practice in identifying and including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and data invariants using assertions in Python. These are fundamental concepts in creation of formal models, and the use of Python assertions allows us to explore them in a familiar setting.\n",

    "## Wordle\n",
    "\n",
    "Wordle is a word game created by Josh Wardle (https://twitter.com/powerlanguish); it is now owned and published by the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html. The instructions for Wordle are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Guess the WORDLE in 6 tries.\n",
    "* Each guess must be a valid 5 letter word. \n",
    "* The color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.\n",
    "* A green letter shows it is in the correct position.\n",
    "* A yellow letter shows it is in the word but in the wrong position.\n",
    "* A grey letter shows that it is not in the word in any position.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building Models\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no right or wrong way to construct a programme (or formal specification) from natural language specifications. We need to consider the purpose, which guides the abstraction decisions. The steps however can be broadly broken down as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Analyse the functional behaviour from the requirements\n",
    "2. Extract a list of possible data types (often from nouns) and functions (often from actions)\n",
    "3. Create a dictionary by giving explanations to items in the list\n",
    "4. Sketch out data types\n",
    "5. Sketch out functions\n",
    "6. Refine and add restrictions\n",
    "7. Review and refine\n",

    "\n",
    "## Functional Behaviour and Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "From the description above, we can identify the key elements of the instructions to understand the functionality and suggest data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* There’s a secret **wordle**\n",
    "    - It has **five** letters (we can infer this though it is not explicit)\n",
    "    - The player loses after **six** tries\n",
    "* The player can make a **guess**\n",
    "    - Guess must be **five** letters\n",
    "    - Guess must be **valid** (= real word?)\n",
    "* The game should output for each letter in a guess:\n",
    "    - If the letter is in the **correct position**\n",
    "    - If the letter in the **wrong position** (but in the word)\n",
    "    - If the letter is **not in the word**"
